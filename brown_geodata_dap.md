## Metadata Elements and Vocabulary

This document describes the standards we will use to create metadata records for datasets that we produce at GeoData@SciLi at the Brown University Library. We are using the [OGM Aardvark Metadata Schema](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/) created by the GeoBlacklight community. This schema is based on Dublin Core and GBL specific fields. We're also following their conventions and best practices for vocabularies and formats.

This Data Application Profile lists *our* specific requirements for metadata based on this schema. We do not use all the fields, and we may require fields that are optional under the general schema.
